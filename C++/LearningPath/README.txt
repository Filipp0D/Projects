This LearningPath folder represents the place where I learn and practice new C++ concepts. It's being made through single projects called "Challenge#X" in increasing order according with the difficulty of what I'm trying to improve with.
In the following lines I'll give a brief overview of the concepts applied in the Challenges:

- Challenge#1:
	- class declaration
	- constructors
	- use of <vector> and <map>
	- libraries: <iostream>, <sstream>, <iomanip>, <cstdlib>, <numeric>, <fstream>, <random>, nlohmann::json


- Challenge#2:
	- pointers and reference
	- smart pointers (shared_ptr)
	- real-time event handling (Observer pattern)
	- asynchronous handling (thread)
	- libraries: <memory>, <chrono>, <thread>, <atomic>, <ctime>

- Challenge#3:
	- State Machine handling
	- advanced smart pointers
	- 

Note: the basic C++ were already taken as acknowledged.
